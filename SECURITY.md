# Security Policy

Thanks for helping make AsBuiltReport safe for everyone.

## Security

AsBuiltReport takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [AsBuiltReport](https://github.com/AsBuiltReport).

While AsBuiltReport is an open source project without a formal bug bounty program, we are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and will ensure that your findings are passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any AsBuiltReport repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to support@asbuiltreport.com with the subject line "SECURITY: [Brief Description]".

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., code injection, credential exposure, or privilege escalation)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
  * Affected versions of AsBuiltReport modules

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Response Timeline

We aim to:
  * Acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours
  * Provide an initial assessment within 7-10 days
  * Keep you informed of our progress throughout the remediation process

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure principles:
  * Security issues will be addressed in a timely manner
  * We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
  * Public disclosure will occur after a fix is available and deployed
  * We will credit reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
